            <h3>Robotics (RC RoboRace, Robo Soccer cars & project)</h3>
            <p>
                I have hands-on experience in designing and building RC RoboRace and Robo Soccer cars using Arduino Uno and BTS motor drivers. This involved programming the Arduino for precise control, configuring the motor drivers to ensure smooth movement, and integrating sensors for navigation and obstacle detection. I also focused on optimizing the cars for speed and agility, essential for competitive performance. Through these projects, I developed a strong understanding of robotics, electronics, and programming principles.

            <h3>Robotics (RC RoboRace, Robo Soccer cars & project)</h3>
            <p>
                I have experience in developing software applications using Java and C# programming languages. I have worked on designing, coding, and debugging applications, focusing on creating efficient and user-friendly solutions. Through these projects, I gained strong skills in object-oriented programming, problem-solving, and software development processes. This experience has helped me build a solid foundation in developing reliable and scalable applications.

            <h3>Bangladesh Scouts</h3>
            <p>
                I was a member of the Bangladesh Scouts and served as the second commander of my scout team. In this role, I gained valuable experience in leading a team, organizing activities, and guiding others. Being part of the Scouts also gave me the chance to participate in various social service projects, helping communities and making a positive impact. This experience taught me leadership skills and the importance of teamwork and service.
