        <h3>Robotics (RC RoboRace, Robo Soccer cars & project)</h3>
        <p>
          I have hands-on experience in designing and building RC RoboRace and
          Robo Soccer cars using Arduino Uno and BTS motor drivers. This
          involved programming the Arduino for precise control, configuring the
          motor drivers to ensure smooth movement, and integrating sensors for
          navigation and obstacle detection. I also focused on optimizing the
          cars for speed and agility, essential for competitive performance.
          Through these projects, I developed a strong understanding of
          robotics, electronics, and programming principles.

        <h3>Robotics (RC RoboRace, Robo Soccer cars & project)</h3>
        <p>
          I have experience in developing software applications using Java and
          C# programming languages. I have worked on designing, coding, and
          debugging applications, focusing on creating efficient and
          user-friendly solutions. Through these projects, I gained strong
          skills in object-oriented programming, problem-solving, and software
          development processes. This experience has helped me build a solid
          foundation in developing reliable and scalable applications.

        <h3>Bangladesh Scouts</h3>
        <p>
          I was a member of the Bangladesh Scouts and served as the second
          commander of my scout team. In this role, I gained valuable experience
          in leading a team, organizing activities, and guiding others. Being
          part of the Scouts also gave me the chance to participate in various
          social service projects, helping communities and making a positive
          impact. This experience taught me leadership skills and the importance
          of teamwork and service.
