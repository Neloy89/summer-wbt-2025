            <h3>Wireless-controlled Robotic Car with a Multi-DOF(4) Object-Manipulating Arm</h3>
            <p>
                The system enables real-time remote navigation and object manipulation, making it suitable for hazardous or inaccessible environments. The robotic platform is built around the Arduino Uno microcontroller, with wireless command input via transmitter-receiver pair. Locomotion is achieved through DC motors driven by BTS7960 motor drivers, while multiple servo motors enable fine control of the robotic arm’s joints. The project emphasizes cost-effectiveness and modular design, serving as an educational prototype for embedded systems and robotics. Simulations using Proteus validated the control logic prior to physical implementation. Future enhancements include sensor integration, IoT connectivity, and autonomous features.

            <h3><strong>MINDCOLOGY</strong> (mental health matters)</h3>
            <p>
                "Mindcology" is an application created using the Java programming language to support mental health and well-being. The application provides users with access to informative resources to better understand their mental state and offers a feature to schedule appointments with doctors for professional consultations. It includes a secure payment system to allow users to pay for services easily and safely. Additionally, the app features a special section where users can access free mental health support services, ensuring that assistance is available to everyone. This project highlights my intermediate Java programming skills and focuses on combining technology with mental health care to create an easy-to-use and helpful platform.

            <h3>Pharmacy Management System</h3>
            <p>
                The <strong>Pharmacy Management System</strong> is an application created using the C# programming language. It allows users to order necessary medicines and request items that are out of stock or unavailable. The system also features secure online payment options for customer convenience. For efficient user management, the application allows the admin to approve customer and employee accounts. Additionally, the system enables the admin and employees to track stock levels and monitor revenue through data stored in a well-organized database. This feature provides real-time insights into inventory and financial performance, helping improve decision-making. All user and employee information is stored in separate database tables, ensuring quick and smooth access. This project highlights my skills in C# programming and database integration, focusing on creating a functional and user-friendly application.

            <h3>Emergency Service System</h3>
            <p>
                The <strong>Emergency Service System</strong> is a user-friendly application designed to reduce response times and improve coordination between fire, police, and ambulance services. It allows users to request help quickly during emergencies like fires, accidents, or crimes. Using GPS and AI technology, the system ensures emergency services reach people as fast as possible. It is built to serve the general public, healthcare seekers, law enforcement, and emergency responders, improving public safety through better communication and faster response.

                The application includes secure login/signup with phone number and OTP verification. Users can request fire, healthcare, or law enforcement services and track their arrival in real time. It offers real-time tracking of emergency vehicles and generates probable causes for faster response. Users can leave feedback after receiving help to ensure better service quality. A penalty system prevents misuse by discouraging false requests. These features make the system efficient, reliable, and easy to use during emergencies.
